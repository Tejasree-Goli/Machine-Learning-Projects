## Toxic Comments Classification

**Dataset**: The dataset for this project is taken from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

**Objective**: 
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the classification of toxic comments in online discussions using the dataset from Kaggle's "Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge." This project aims to create a model that can accurately identify and categorize toxic comments into various predefined classes, thereby enabling the moderation of online content. Additionally, the project seeks to explore various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide insights into the nature of toxic behavior in online communities.

**Approach**:
After performing exploratory data anaysis, implemented XGBoost Classifier and CNN models to achieve the objective.

**Challenges**:
Dealing with multiple categories of toxicity (e.g., hate speech, insults, threats) can make classification more complex. Developing a model that accurately identifies and categorizes each type of toxic comment is a challenge.
